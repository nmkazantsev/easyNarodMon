Short description:

void setHead(String deviceId);
Starts a Stirng with request to server. Adds there headers and inserts there device id (usually mac address of device is being used)

void setHead(String device Id, String name, String lat, String lon, String alt) ;
Allows to also add Device name and coordinates of it from GPS

void addSensor(String value, String sensorId) ;
void addSensor(float value, String sensorId) ;
void addSensor(int value, String sensorId) ;
add a sensor to the request string. Please, call it only after addHead
Also these functions are declared with additional String param: sensor name. 

String sendData();
Sends the generated requests, returns the answers from server or "connection error" if it happened

void enableDebug();
